      <description>I grew up in Rawalpindi, Pakistan in a family, where I learnt early on the importance of education/skills, getting things done and developed hustle, resilience, and curiosity - Special thanks to my Parents!
After high-school, I landed at University of British Columbia (UBC) on a full ride scholarship. My experience at UBC taught me the importance of building relationships, story-telling, authenticity, serendipity, and continuous growth. It also gave me an opportunity to take classes in various fields of education, experience different cultures, and grow 10X.</description>
