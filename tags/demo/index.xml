      <description>I believe there is an opportunity to build D2C brands for the Pakistani middle-class consumer.
Few reasons:  In Pakistan internet and cell-phone penetration is growing rapidly  We are also seeing an increase in online purchases and sellers, especially major players such as Ali Baba helping build the ecosystem Financial payment systems are improving Covid&#39;19 forced people to move online, so there is more willingness to adopt online based products.</description>

      <description>NLP technology has advanced significantly in the past two years similar to how computer vision accelerated due to imagenet. We can expect some great products in this decade leveraging NLP. These advancements mean problems that had long and complex unstructured data can now be tackled. One area of interest for me is how can we build an actionable, interoperable, and useable data layer using clinical notes and improve provider operations and care delivery as a by product.</description>

      <description>I grew up in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. I learned early on the importance of education/skills, getting things done, hustle, resilience, and curiosity - Special thanks to my parents for it!
After high school, I attended the University of British Columbia (UBC) on a full-ride scholarship. My experience at UBC taught me the importance of building relationships, story-telling, authenticity, recognizing opportunities and continuous growth. It also gave me the chance to expose myself to a variety of things, allowing me to grow 10X.</description>
